**Observation-Centric SORT (OC-SORT)** is a pure motion-model-based multi-object tracker. It aims to improve tracking robustness in **crowded scenes and when objects are in non-linear motion**. It is designed by recognizing and fixing limitations in Kalman filter and [SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00763). It is flexible to integrate with different detectors and matching modules, such as appearance similarity. It remains, **Simple, Online and Real-time**.

* Results are from reusing detections of previous methods and shared hyper-parameters. Tune the implementation adaptive to datasets may get higher performance.
* The inference speed is ~28FPS by a RTX 2080Ti GPU. If the detections are provided, the inference speed of OC-SORT association is 700FPS by a i9-3.0GHz CPU.
* A sample from DanceTrack-test set is as below and more visualizatiosn are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-T4jhHwhOAp42DGJ115yMlC7CkB-PNxy?usp=sharing)

## Roadmap
We are still actively updating OC-SORT. We always welcome contributions to make it better for the community. We have some high-priorty to-dos as below:
- [x] Add more asssocitaion cost choices: GIoU, CIoU, etc.
- [ ] Support OC-SORT in [mmtracking](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmtracking).
- [ ] Add more deployment options and improve the inference speed.
- [ ] Make OC-SORT adaptive to customized detector.
